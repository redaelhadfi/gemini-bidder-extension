Architecture
- Manifest V3 Chrome extension
  - Background (service worker): calls Gemini/OpenAI, routes based on provider
  - Content script: scrapes page details, fills form fields
  - Popup (React + Material-UI + Vite + TypeScript): primary UI and user flows
  - Options (React + Material-UI): provider, API key, model configuration (stored in chrome.storage.sync)

Project Structure
```
gemini-bidder-extension/
├─ background.js          # Service worker (API calls, routing, messaging)
├─ content.js             # Page scraper + form filler (injected on project pages)
├─ manifest.json          # MV3 manifest
├─ images/                # Extension icons
├─ src/
│  ├─ popup/
│  │  ├─ index.html      # Popup entry HTML (built by Vite)
│  │  ├─ main.tsx        # Bootstraps React popup with Material-UI theme
│  │  └─ popup.tsx       # Popup UI/logic with Material-UI components
│  └─ options/

├─ package.json           # Scripts + deps (React, Vite, TS, Material-UI)
├─ vite.config.ts         # Multi-page build (popup + options)
└─ tsconfig.json
```

Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- Chrome/Chromium (MV3 support)

Setup (Build & Install)
1) Install dependencies and build
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
This produces a complete extension bundle in `dist/` with:
- `dist/src/popup/index.html` (popup)
- `dist/src/options/index.html` (options)
- `dist/background.js`, `dist/content.js`, `dist/manifest.json`, `dist/images/*`

2) Load the extension in Chrome
- Go to `chrome://extensions`
- Enable Developer mode (top-right)
- Click “Load unpacked” and select the `dist` folder

Configuration (Providers, Keys, Models)
- Options page (right-click the extension → Options or click “Configure API Key” in the popup):
  - AI Provider: Google Gemini or OpenAI
  - API Key: paste your key for the chosen provider
  - Model:
    - Gemini: e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`, `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`
    - OpenAI: e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`
- Keys and settings are stored in Chrome sync storage (local to your browser account)

Usage
1) Open any Freelancer project page (URL contains `freelancer.com/projects/`)
2) Open the extension popup
3) Choose your provider (Gemini/OpenAI) — you can also set a default in Options
4) Click “Generate Bid Preview”
   - The extension extracts: description, budget, default bid amount, delivery time
   - It calls your selected provider/model to generate a short, human-like proposal
   - The preview is shown with fields prefilled; adjust if needed
5) Click “Insert Bid into Page” to populate the form on Freelancer
6) Optional: Click “Generate Questions” to produce 3–5 concise clarifying questions

Keyboard Shortcuts
- Cmd/Ctrl + G: Generate bid preview
- Cmd/Ctrl + C: Copy proposal
- Enter: Insert bid (when preview is visible)

Permissions & Privacy
- `storage`: save API keys and settings in chrome.storage.sync
- `activeTab`, `host_permissions` for `freelancer.com`: read project details and fill the bid form
- `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/*` (Gemini) and `https://api.openai.com/*` (OpenAI): call model APIs
- API keys are used only to call the provider you select. They are not transmitted elsewhere.

Troubleshooting
- Popup says “Not on a Freelancer project page”
  - Ensure the active tab is a project page (URL contains `freelancer.com/projects/`)
- “Connection failed. Please REFRESH the Freelancer tab and try again.”
  - The content script needs to be injected/active; refresh the tab and try again
- “API key missing”
  - Open Options and add a key for the current provider. You can also switch provider in the popup.
- Provider errors like 503/overloaded
  - Temporary; wait a few seconds and try again
- Bid amount or delivery time empty
  - The extension tries multiple selectors; if a page variant changes, share the DOM snippet and update selectors in `content.js`

Customization
- **Personalized Prompts**: The extension uses your actual freelance profile (5.0 rating, 48+ projects) to generate credible bids
- **Smart Specialization Detection**: Automatically detects project type (AI/ML, cloud, web scraping, frontend, backend, etc.) based on job description
- **Professional Tone**: References your proven track record and international client base naturally
- Change models at runtime via Options → Model
- Adjust the generation prompt (tone and rules): see `buildPrompt()` in `background.js`
- Tweak UI (colors/layout): edit Material-UI theme in main.tsx files
- Add new providers: extend settings, add a `generateBidWithX()` in `background.js`, update options/popup

Roadmap
- Two-column responsive layout (Bid on left, Questions + Project details on right)
- Provider/model quick toggle in popup header
- Optional tone/length selectors
- Export/copy to templates
